# Project Description
This project analyzes the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on tourism in Europe, with a specific focus on Portugal and its main tourism competitors. Utilizing the CRISP-DM process model, we serve as consultants for the Portuguese National Tourism Board Organization (NTBO), analyzing user-generated content from TripAdvisor reviews to identify and understand visitor patterns pre- and post-pandemic.

## Objectives
 - Characterize and describe visitor patterns at Portuguese attractions.
 - Compare these patterns with those of Portugal's main tourism competitors.
 - Analyze visitor associations, similarities between attractions or visitors, and segment visitors using RFM analysis (with ratings instead of monetary values).
